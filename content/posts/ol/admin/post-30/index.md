## Details

Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition, the current long-term support release of Oracle Database, is now certified and available on the popular Arm architecture for cloud and on-premises deployments.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Ampere A1 compute platform provides deterministic performance, linear scalability, and an energy-efficient, sustainable, eco-friendly design for Oracle Database customers. Building applications is free to try, easy to learn, and fast to explore.

These guides use the container method to install Oracle Database 19c on Oracle Linux on an OCI Ampere A1 compute instance.
