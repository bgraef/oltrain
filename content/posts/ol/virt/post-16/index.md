## Details

This Podman video outlines the difference between a Public, and Private, Container Registry. It summarises the difference between a 'container registry' and a 'container repository'. It shows how Podman uses the registries.conf file to determine which registries to search, then provides a demonstration of pulling, and using, an Oracle Linux container.
