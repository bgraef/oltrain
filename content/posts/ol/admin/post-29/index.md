## Details

Oracle's [Java Platform](https://www.oracle.com/java/), Standard Edition ([Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html)) lets you develop and deploy Java applications on desktops and servers.

The Java Platform Standard Edition Development Kit (JDK) includes tools for developing, testing, and monitoring programs written in the Java programming language and running on the Java platform. The JDK offers developers and users a rich user interface and the performance, versatility, portability, and security that today's applications require.
 
Beyond these great features, Oracle provides the [Oracle JDK free](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/free-java-license) for commercial and production use. When you combine Oracle Java with Oracle's highly performant, reliable, and cloud-ready operating system, [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/), you get an ideal environment with out-of-the-box optimizations for Oracle software, excellent for running Oracle Java.
