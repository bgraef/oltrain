## Details

In this video, the primary features and concepts of Oracle Linux Manager and OS Management Hub are compared for OS management of on-premises Oracle Linux system deployments. This video compares the service architecture, interfaces, software sources vs software channels, registering new instances, groups, lifecycles, and  making updates to managed systems between these two Oracle Linux OS Management solutions.

Oracle Linux Manager, formerly known as Spacewalk, provides a set of tools for managing the Oracle Linux software life cycle in small or large deployments. Oracle Linux Manager also helps you automate a kickstart installation, system configuration, and maintenance tasks, which enables you to rapidly deploy proven and consistent software configurations for Oracle Linux systems.

Oracle OS Management hub is the newest OS Management service that manages and monitors updates and patches for Oracle Linux environments in private data centers while providing a centralized management console as a service of Oracle Cloud infrastructure.
