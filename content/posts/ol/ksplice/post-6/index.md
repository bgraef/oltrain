## Details

Oracle Ksplice provides a method of patching your Oracle Linux system that has the following advantages:

  - Critical security patches for Linux kernels, hypervisors, and critical user-space libraries are applied immediately.
  - Updates are non-intrusive because the process does not require reboots and system downtime.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

   - Run Oracle Ksplice commands
   - Obtain information about updating your system from Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN).

### Prerequisites

- Minimum of a single Oracle Linux system

- Each system should have Oracle Linux installed and configured with:
    - A non-root user account with sudo access
    - Set up as a standard or enhanced Oracle Ksplice client
    - Access to the internet
