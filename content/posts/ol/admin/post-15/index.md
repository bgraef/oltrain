## Details

When administering a Linux system, you will eventually need to create users and groups, whether for a particular software installation or to perform a specific task. As for groups, it's a great way to control directory access.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

  - Create a new user and explore the user's home directory
  - Create a new group and add a user to the group
  - Utilize the user private group scheme and implement write access to a directory
  - Administer the `sudo` command for granting **root** privileges

### Prerequisites

- Minimum of a single Oracle Linux system

- Each system should have Oracle Linux installed and configured with:
    - A non-root user account with sudo access
    - Access to the Internet
