## Details

Learn to manage and monitor OS updates for Oracle Linux compute instances using Oracle OS Management Hub in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Use a centralized management console to update Oracle Linux OS and monitor updates and patches in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

  - Create a registration profile
  - Register new and existing OCI compute instances with OS Management Hub
  - Review reports for OS enhancements, security updates, bug fixes, and instance activity
  - Run update jobs and monitor job statuses

### Prerequisites

Access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy with:

  - An administrative user group, a dynamic group identifying instance resources, and the IAM policies that enable OS Management Hub.
  - Oracle Linux compute instances.
  - Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) or configured network access that supports OS Management Hub.
