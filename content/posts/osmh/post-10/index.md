## Details

This video covers basic management of jobs in Oracle OS Management Hub. A job is an action that OS Management Hub takes against one or more instances, such as installing updates or attaching software sources to an instance or group. When a job runs, it dispatches work to the instance. A job can run immediately or be scheduled for a future date and time. Some jobs, such as update jobs, can also be scheduled as a recurring event.

This video introduces users to basic job types, navigating to jobs and the job resource, managing scheduled jobs, and reviewing the log and error messages associated with a job in OS Management Hub. You can use these messages to troubleshoot issues with jobs.
