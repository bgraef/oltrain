> Effective April 23, 2025, the Oracle OS Management service reaches end of life (EOL). OS Management is replaced by [OS Management Hub](https://oracle-samples.github.io/oltrain/tracks/osmh/), which provides an improved user experience with new features, including patch deployments through lifecycle stages, enhanced job scheduling, and reporting capabilities.
> 
> Before the EOL date, we recommend that you migrate managed instances from OS Management to OS Management Hub.
