## Details

Create a profile in OS Management Hub to register an instance with the service. A profile is required to register an instance with OS Management Hub. Profiles provide a way to consistently define how an instance registers with the service. A profile defines the default software sources for an instance, the group to assign to an instance, or the lifecycle environment stage to associate with the instance. This video will cover viewing and managing profiles from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, creating a profile, viewing user-defined profiles in non-root compartments, viewing service profiles and default profiles in a root compartment, and viewing profile details.
