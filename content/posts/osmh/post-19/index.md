## Details

Learn how to manually create the required Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI) groups and policies to enable Oracle OS Management Hub. In this video, you will learn how to manually create an administrator group and add users, write matching rules for a dynamic group of instance resources that will be managed by OS management hub, find compartment and subcompartment OCIDs, and write the policy that defines permissions for users and instance resources to use OS management hub. Examples of dynamic group rules and policies are provided covering broad sets of permissions, limiting administrator groups, and narrowing permission to specific compartments or subcompartments.
