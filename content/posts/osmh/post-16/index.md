## Details

This video demonstrates how to register Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) compute instances with Oracle OS Management Hub. Two registration workflows are covered - registering compute instances during the create compute instance workflow and registering existing oracle cloud compute instances that are not already managed by OS Management Service. To register a compute instance with OS Management Hub, the OS Management Hub agent plugin must be enabled within the Oracle Cloud Agent settings. OS Management Hub requires that Oracle Cloud Agent versions 1.40 or later be installed prior to enabling the plugin.
