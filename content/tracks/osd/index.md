{{< lead >}}The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Secure Desktops service allows an administrator to create a set of identically configured virtual desktops, which individual users can then securely access.
{{< /lead >}}

Secure Desktops is ideal for organizations that need to provide employees with controlled access to a preconfigured desktop environment. An administrator can create pools of desktops in their tenancy, based on existing compute shapes or custom images. All configuration for the desktop and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is completed by the administrator, making it possible for non-technical users to securely access and use a virtual desktop for their day-to-day work. Secure Desktops controls all access to the virtual desktops, protecting Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources and customer data from malicious client activity.

The Secure Desktops service provides:

- A way to create and maintain a large number of identical desktops.
- Controlled access to a virtual desktop for potentially non-technical users.
- Data security by storing data on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources and not on an individual client device.
