## Details

These guides provide instructions for installing the NGINX web server and enabling it on Oracle Linux 8 or later.

### Background

NGINX is a lightweight HTTP/S server that is capable of higher performance and lower memory use than a typical Apache web server deployment. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of some functionality and flexibility. NGINX has also gained in popularity as a powerful proxy service that is capable of functioning as a direct HTTP proxy, a reverse proxy with caching, an SMTP, POP3 or IMAP proxy or as a generic TCP/UDP proxy. NGINX also provides load balancing services with fault tolerance.

On earlier Oracle Linux versions, the NGINX web server was provided as part of a software collection package. The web server package is now directly available from the Oracle Linux 8 Application Streams repository and therefore simpler to deploy and configure.

### What Do You Need?

-   Any system with Oracle Linux 8 installed
