## Details

Learn how to create and register a system running Oracle Linux 8, version 8.7 or newer in a private data center or 3rd party cloud as a management station with Oracle OS Management Hub on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A Management Station is a required component for managing OS environments that are hosted outside of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A management station is not required to manage instances located in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It is a system or instance in a location like on-premises, 3rd party cloud, or private data center that performs two important roles. The management station mirrors and distributes operating system content to other managed instances hosted in the same location and also acts as the proxy for those managed instances by communicating with the OS Management Hub service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
