## Details

This video demonstrates how to use VBoxManage to modify properties of a virtual machine(VM) on an Oracle Linux system. VBoxManage is the command-line interface to Oracle VirtualBox. Learn how to write the VBoxManage showvminfo command that displays all of the virtual machines properties like CPU count, memory, VNIC and more. Then learn to modify those properties with the VBoxManage modifyvm command. Modifyvm only works on registered virtual machines that are not currently running.
