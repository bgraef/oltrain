## Details

VLANs or Virtual Local Area Networks allow the network to be divided into smaller logical sections, or broadcast domains, to better manage the amount of traffic being generated by the attached systems.

A VLAN separates multiple network devices into logical groups that can communicate as though they are attached to the same network, regardless of their actual physical location on the broadcast LAN.

VLAN tags are used to identify the separate VLAN networks, with network switches deciding how to route traffic within and between systems based on the VLAN tags.

### Objectives

This lab, demonstrates how to:

   - Create a VLAN interface using the `nmcli` command
   - Delete a VLAN interface using the `nmcli` command
   - Create a VLAN interface using the `ip` command
   - Delete a VLAN interface using the `ip` command

### Prerequisites

   - A cloud instance system with current release Oracle Linux installed
