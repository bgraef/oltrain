---

{{< lead >}} Oracle Private Cloud Appliance is a highly scalable, integrated system that makes it easy for customers to deploy and manage diverse workloads on multiple operating systems, utilizing APIs and management tools that are compatible with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). 

Customers can develop containerized, cloud native applications using architectural patterns and tools that are consistent infrastructure-as-code environments across private and public clouds. 

Private Cloud Appliance runs mission-critical enterprise applications in high-performance virtual machines and offers trusted partition licensing that reduces Oracle Database and applications software costs. {{< /lead >}}

## Service Enclave Tasks

The Oracle Private Cloud Appliance runs its own specific and separate administration area known as the Service Enclave. The Service Enclave is the part of the system where the appliance infrastructure is controlled. Access is closely monitored and restricted to privileged administrators. Functionality provided by the Service Enclave includes hardware and capacity management, tenancy management, system and component upgrade, system backup and restore, monitoring and tools for service and support, and so on.

This section provides video training for Day 0 configuration and for administrator tasks performed from the Service Enclave. To access the Service Enclave, you use either the Service Web UI or Service CLI.

## Compute Enclave Tasks

The Compute Enclave offers functionality to users of the cloud environment, and are very similar in operation to the corresponding Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Users of the Compute Enclave have certain permissions to enable the deployment of customer workloads through compute instances and associated resources. Cloud services include the compute and storage services, identity and access management, and networking.

This section provides video training for administrator and user tasks performed from the Compute Enclave. To access the Compute Enclave, you use either the Compute Web UI or OCI CLI.
