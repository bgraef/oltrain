## Details

Learn how to create and register an instance or system in a data center as a Management Station with Oracle OS Management Hub on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A Management Station is a key component of Oracle OS Management Hub. It is a system or instance in the data center that performs two important roles. The management station mirrors and distributes content to other managed instances in the data center and also acts as network proxy for those managed instances by communicating with the OS Management Hub in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
