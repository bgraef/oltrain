## Details

In this video, vendor software sources are added to the root compartment of a tenancy, replicated to a sub compartment, attached to a group of instances, and attached to an individual instance. A software source is a collection of packages and modules. Use software sources to control the content that's available to instances managed by OS Management Hub. When you add software sources to OS Management Hub, it's on a per region basis.
A vendor software source is a repository of content provided by an OS vendor. Vendor software sources reside in the root compartment, but can be replicated to other compartments. Some vendor software sources might be restricted, or be a premium product, requiring an entitlement to unlock access.
