## Details

Whether upgrading from a previous release or starting with a single host installation, both environments can migrate to a clustered deployment. Administrators need to plan their topology before migrating, as the cluster may consist of a combination of Control Plane and Execution Plane nodes and a remote database.

These guides provide instructions for migrating a single host Release installation to a clustered deployment with a remote database.

### Objectives

In this lab, you'll learn how to:

  - Setup a remote database
  - Migrate to a clustered deployment

### Prerequisites

  - A system with Oracle Linux Automation Manager installed.
