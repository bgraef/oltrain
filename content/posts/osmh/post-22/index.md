## Details

Learn to manage Oracle Linux updates for many OCI compute instances as a unified and standardized group in Oracle OS Management Hub.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

  - Create a group in Oracle OS Management Hub
  - Create a group profile to register OCI Compute instances
  - Manage group members by adding and removing compute instances
  - Manage the group manifest by installing and removing Oracle Linux Packages and Modules
  - Review group reports for OS enhancements, security updates, bug fixes, and instance activity
  - Immediately run update jobs and schedule recurring updates for the group
  - Monitor job statuses and view associated work

### Prerequisites

Access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy with:

  - An administrative user group, a dynamic group identifying instance resources, and the IAM policies that enable OS Management Hub.
  - Oracle Linux compute instances.
  - Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) or configured network access that supports OS Management Hub.
