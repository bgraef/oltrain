## Details

This video demonstrates how to register Oracle Linux environments hosted in on-premises data centers or in 3rd party cloud deployments as managed instances with Oracle OS Management Hub. Oracle OS Management Hub is used to manage and monitor updates and patches for Oracle Linux environments using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure web console as a centralized management hub. A managed instance is a bare metal server or virtual machine that is registered with Oracle OS Management Hub. The Managed instance receives updates and patches from the OS Management Hub service which supports Oracle Linux 7 or later OS versions.
