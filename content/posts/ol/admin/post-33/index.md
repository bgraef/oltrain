## Details

Whether you run your Oracle Linux system headless or with a desktop environment, you will eventually need to configure the host name and locale for the system. The host name is simply a unique label or name assigned to a computer or device on a network, allowing it to be easily identified and distinguished from other devices. In comparison, the locale setting lets you specify the language for system settings and user interfaces.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn to:

- Set the system host name
- Set the system locale and system language

### Prerequisites

- Minimum of a single Oracle Linux system

- Each system should have Oracle Linux installed and configured with:
  - A non-root user account with sudo access
  - Access to the Internet
