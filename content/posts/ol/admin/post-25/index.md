## Details

FreeIPA is an open-source identity and authentication management system for Linux networked environments. The server includes the 389 Directory Server as the central data store, providing full multi-master LDAPv3 functionality.

Beyond the scope of this tutorial, FreeIPA also provides MIT Kerberos for Single-Sign-on authentication, the Dogtag Certificate Authority, and optional Domain Name management through an ISC Bind server.

These guides show how to install FreeIPA and configure the included LDAP directory.
