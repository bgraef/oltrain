## Details

Whether upgrading from a previous release or starting with a single host installation, both environments can migrate to a clustered deployment. Administrators need to plan their topology before migrating, as the cluster may consist of a combination of Control Plane, Execution, and Hop nodes and a remote database.

After following this tutorial, you'll know how to migrate a single host installation to a clustered deployment with a remote database.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

- Setup a remote database
- Migrate to a clustered deployment

### Prerequisites

- A system with Oracle Linux Automation Manager installed.

  For details on installing Oracle Linux Automation Manager, see the [Oracle Linux Automation Manager Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux-automation-manager/).
