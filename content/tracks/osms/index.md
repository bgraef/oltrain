> **Note:** 
>
> On April 23, 2025, the OS Management Service reaches end of life (EOL). Effective now, the service is no longer available in regions where you are not already using OS Management service, or to new users with new tenancies.
> 
> Before the EOL date, we recommend that you [migrate your managed instances](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/os-management/osms/osms-migration-osmh.htm) to the [OS Management Hub service](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/osmh/doc/home.htm). If you are an Oracle Autonomous Linux user, see [Important Maintenance Event](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/os-management/osms/al-maintenance-event.htm).
