## Details

This video introduces and demonstrates the use of lifecycle environments to manage and develop versioned custom software sources. Versioned custom operating system(OS) software is tightly controlled and promoted through defined lifecycle stages providing a pipeline for engineers to develop OS content in a development stage, QA teams to test the OS content in a testing stage, and finally for end users to receive the OS content in a production stage. The video demonstrates a standard promotion process where OS content is moved from one stage to another by promotion. Versioned custom software source details, lifecycle environment details, and lifecycle stage instances are briefly defined and explored.
