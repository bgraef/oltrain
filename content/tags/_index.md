This site includes support for user-defined groupings of content called taxonomies. Taxonomies are classifications of logical relationships between content.

The site automatically creates taxonomies for `tags` and `categories` as a default. The items below show the single page listing the terms within the `tags` taxonomy, and clicking each term shows a page listing all pages marked as part of that taxonomy.
