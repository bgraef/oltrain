## Labs

{{< lead >}} Each hands-on lab provides step-by-step procedures to complete specific tasks in an Oracle-provided free lab environment. Follow the procedures to connect to your Oracle Linux compute instance on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and complete the labs. Alternatively, you can perform the lab steps on your own Oracle Linux environment. {{< /lead >}}

### [Use NetworkManager and IP Command on Oracle Linux](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/6cbaab1f-835c-445e-89eb-b42ba3e679bb)

Learn how to use the nmcli and ip commands to configure and manage network interfaces on Oracle Linux.

In this lab you work with the Oracle Linux CLI utilities, nmcli and ip, to monitor and manage network devices and connections.

The lab's intent is to introduce you to these utilities and practice using their common features to simulate a work environment. Not all of the features are presented. The lab runs in a virtualized environment and therefore limits what can be presented and practiced.

### [Create Network Bonds using Network Manager CLI](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/fc37cd13-6a90-49df-adc1-6c3b40239265)

Learn how to create a logical group interface by bonding multiple interfaces together using the nmcli and ip commands on Oracle Linux.

A network bond groups multiple physical network interfaces on a system into a single logical group interface and is connected to a network switch. Bonding can facilitate higher connection availability through redundancy by maintaining the connection if a link in the bond group fails. Also, the aggregation of the physical network interface provides higher throughput by load balancing the traffic across the interfaces in the bond.

### [Create VLANs on Oracle Linux](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/e8070728-d90b-41c9-8984-e4b1d98cee88)

Learn how to create and delete VLAN interfaces on Oracle Linux.

VLANs or Virtual Local Area Networks allow the network to be divided into smaller logical sections, or broadcast domains, to better manage the amount of traffic being generated by the attached systems.  A VLAN separates multiple network devices into logical groups that can communicate as though they are attached to the same network, regardless of their actual physical location on the broadcast LAN.  VLAN tags are used to identify the separate VLAN networks, with network switches deciding how to route traffic within and between systems based on the VLAN tag
