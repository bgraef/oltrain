## Details

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open-source type-1 (bare-metal) hypervisor. This functionality permits a host system, such as Oracle Linux 8, to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) or guests when running on supported hardware.

These guides will deploy Oracle Linux Kernel Virtualization Manager (KVM) to create a virtual machine.

### Objectives

- Deploy KVM
- Deploy Cockpit for Virtual Machines
- Create Virtual Machine from an ISO
- Create Virtual Machine using Oracle Cloud Images

### Prerequisites

Any Oracle Linux 8 or later system with the following configurations:

- a non-root user with sudo permissions
