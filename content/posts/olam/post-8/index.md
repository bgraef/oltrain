## Details

The community.libvirt collection provides libvirt modules and plugins supported by the Ansible libvirt community. These modules and plugins help manage virtual machines (VMs) and containers using the [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) API.

These guides show how to use this collection in Oracle Linux Automation Manager and interacts with an Oracle Linux instance running KVM.

### Objectives

In this lab, you'll learn how to:

  - Create a playbook that uses the community.libvirt collection
  - Configure credentials for Ansible Galaxy
  - Create a Job Template
  - Run the Job

### Prerequisites

  - A system with Oracle Linux Automation Manager installed
  - Access to a git repository
  - An Oracle Linux system with KVM installed
