## Details

Custom software sources in OS Management Hub let you control the packages and modules available to your managed instances. OS Management Hub has flexible and powerful options for creating custom software sources. You can apply filters to limit the set of packages and modules or provide a reference package list from an existing Oracle Linux instance. Package dependencies can also be auto-resolved. You can create custom software sources using the Oracle Cloud Console, the OCI CLI, or programmatically with the OCI API/SDK. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to take a reference package list from an Oracle Linux instance and use Oracle Cloud Console to create a custom or versioned custom software source in OS Management Hub.
